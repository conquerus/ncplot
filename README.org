* NCPlot
** Disclaimer
This program is still a work in progress and not functional beyond
a proof of concept.
** Overview
This is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses][ncurses]] based terminal plotting program. The motivation is
to provide a highly portable yet still useful (i.e. multidimensional)
plotting program. For instance NCPlot could be used on a high
performance computing (HPC) system (where only a terminal is
available) to quickly check the output of simulations; avoiding
unnecessarily transferring large data files to local workstations for
visualization.
** Install
1. NCPlot requires =ncurses=. It can be installed on Debian
   based systems (Ubuntu) using =sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
   libncursesw5-dev=.
2. Use make to install =make clean all=
3. The executable is saved in =./bin=
** Use
At present the program only accepts three commands: =load=, =plot=, and
=exit=. Enter a command by first typing =i=. The commands are fairly
obvious and simple at this point. More information can be obtained
from the example below.
** Example
A python program to generate a sample data set can be found in the
=./test_data= folder ([[file:./test_data/generate_test_data.py][generate_test_data.py]]). The data file (=test.dat=) will be
about 71MB and contain one million data points, but NCPlot will have no
trouble and will load it in about one second. To plot the data using NCPlot:
1. navigate to the root directory 
2. start NCPlot by running =./bin/ncplot=
3. type =i= then =load=
4. enter =3= as the number of variables
5. type =i= then =plot=
6. enter =3= as the number of variables (I know it's redundant...still
   a WIP)
7. for the =x column=, =y column=, and =data column= enter =0=, =1=,
   and =2=, respectively
The output should look something like the figure below (top), the output of
Matplotlib is also shown for comparison (bottom).
