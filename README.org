* NCPlot
** Disclaimer
This program is still a work in progress and not functional beyond
a proof of concept.
** Overview
This is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses][ncurses]] based terminal plotting program for
multidimensional plots.
** Install
1. This program requires =ncurses=. It can be installed on Debian
   based systems (Ubuntu) using =sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
   libncursesw5-dev=
2. Use make to install =make clean all=
3. The executable is saved in =./bin=
** Use
At present the program only accepts three commands: =load, plot, and
exit=. Enter a command by first typing =i=. The commands are fairly
obvious and simple at this point. More information can be obtained
from the example below.
** Example
A python program to generate a sample data set can be found in the
=./test_data= folder ([[file:./test_data/generate_test_data.py][generate_test_data.py]]). The data file will be
about 75MB and contain 1 million data points, but NCPlot will
have no trouble and load it in about one second. To load the test data
(=test.dat=) using NCPlot:
1. navigate to the root directory 
2. start NCPlot by running =./bin/ncplot=
3. type =i= then =load=
4. enter =3= as the number of variables
5. type =i= then =plot=
6. enter =3= as the number of variables (I know it's redundant...still
   a WIP)
7. for the =x column=, =y column=, and =data column= enter =0=, =1=,
   and =2=, respectively
The output should look something like the figure below (left), the output of
Matplotlib is also shown for comparison (right).
